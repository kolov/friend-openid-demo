# Simple app using friend OpenID 

Application letting the uset login with Google OpenID using https://github.com/cemerick/friend.

The official friend demo at https://github.com/cemerick/friend-demo is a great starting point, 
but I missed the details of how to handle failed authorizations, resource protection and roles in the OpenID part. I have them sorted out fot myself in thes liitle app. 

It let the user log in/out, shows xoem date of the logged user end logs all avaliable identity information.

See http://kolov-it.com/openid-friend/ for a bit more details.
