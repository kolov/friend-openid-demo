# Simple app using friend OpenID 

The official friend demo at https://github.com/cemerick/friend-demo is a great starting point, 
but I missed the details 
of how to handle failed authorizations, resource protection and roles in the OpenID part. 

See http://kolov-it.com/openid-friend/ for a bit more details.

See it in action at http://open-friend.herokuapp.com/
